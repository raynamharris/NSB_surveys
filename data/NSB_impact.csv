An investment in better storage containers might help better preserve equipment from year to year.","Field biologists could benefit from the perspectives and approaches that are the focus of NS&B, but field biologists seem to be poorly represented in the course. These biologists routinely make observations of animal behavior in the wild and interpret them in relation to evolutionary processes. Many then jump directly to genetic-level analyses, often completely ignoring organismal level features. These students would be a good addition to the course: they often are already familiar with genetic approaches, they appreciate behavior, and they stand to benefit the most from learning the neuroscience and physiology in the course.The course could include more computational approaches.

We didn't always have a chance to talk about or think about our results. There was less emphasis on learning than there was on data presentation. 2. Different faculty had different expectations of the students. Some faculty were quite supportive of the lab being a learning environment. Some didn't care if you actually produced data, as long as you were productive and learned something. Other faculty literally said, ""If you don't have a data slide submitted by 1am, I'm calling on you in the morning.""3. ","As I stated above, I think 6 weeks would be an ideal length.

The intensity and amount of lecture plus wetlab gave me a crash course in some neuroscience theory and practice which I still use today. I took what I learned at NS&B and began a new research track in my home-lab using intracellular recordings on butterfly eyes.2. The amount of different techniques and systems really broadened my knowledge about which animal model and which techniques are best suited for different kinds of research questions.3. Meeting and getting to know all of the faculty and students was an amazing opportunity and I still keep in touch with people at conferences, and considering doing a post-doc with some of the faculty.","1. I had just finished my first year of graduate school, and there was a baseline level of knowledge that was understood that everyone already had, especially in the leech and crab modules. As I said above, I think that it was really a positive thing because I learned a lot really quickly. However, maybe beginning students are more at risk for falling behind in the course. 2. There were no formal coding/programming/Matlab lectures, which made it really difficult to finish things on time because I was struggling with code for hours and hours. It would be great to have a (maybe optional) coding crash course - especially with some useful commands or a list of pre-written basic scripts specific to NS&B or the module you are in - at some point in the course. 3. That's all I have. It really was a great course, and even without the above suggestions I learned on my own and got through it more knowledgeable and confident in my skills as a young scientist.","I really like the focus on neuroethology for some of the modules. I hope to see that continue in the future. I come from a more evolutionary background and so working with mice and rats and human disease models the whole time would have been less interesting to me.

Students have the opportunity to work with multiple organisms. Faculty have the opportunity to collaborate and work with or alongside each other.,"1) Each module happens too quickly. 2 weeks is not enough time to sufficiently learn a new technique or approach and to then apply it in a real experiment. The students were so overworked that there wasn't enough time for synthesis of the material they were learning. If the course was intended to be a crash course in mere exposure to techniques, then that was achieved in spades. However, if the goal was to have students think critically about using new approaches and to learn how to ask research questions from new perspectives... they simply didn't have enough time.2) For the behavioral aspect of the molecular module, there weren't suitable facilities for running animals in various behavioral paradigms. Birds were housed in a tent!3) The lectures were disorganized. Allowing the faculty to give two lectures on topics of their choice may be easier on the faculty, but probably doesn't provide a logical flow for the students.","I think NS&B would benefit from having fewer cycles, and making the cycles a bit longer. Alternatively, students could quickly learn all of the potential research techniques that are available to them over the course of one month (bootcamp style), and then pick one and spend the second month conducting a real experiment. This would allow students to obtain a substantial grasp on a new approach/technique/model system and to even generate solid data for potential publications. However, restructuring the course in such a manner would make it tricky with juggling when faculty need to be present and for how long. Of course, there are pros and cons to every option.Regardless, I think the course needs to be restructured in some way so that students don't walk away in a dazed stupor, but instead can walk away from the course having truly learned something they can use in the future, having produced something of substance, and/or having experienced something that can guide their future decisions as a researcher. I think this was accomplished with some students, but I think it's also possible to restructure the course in a way that can benefit more students.",,,,,Female,"White, non-Hispanic",,,,,,,,,,,,,Very frequently,Frequently,Very frequently,Occasionally,Occasionally,Very Rarely,Never,Never,Very Rarely,Rarely,Never,"Tested new teaching approaches, Tried new techniques, Familiarized myself with new equipment (loaned by vendors), Met future collaborators",,14,1,,"It introduced me to new products, It made me aware of the many options available, I have bought equipment/supplies because I used them at NS&B, I have stayed in contact with sales and technical reps",Frequently,,Participated as faculty in the Integrative Molecular Module,Don't yet have an independent position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know how similar these two courses are so my knowledge I believe is out of date. Just to throw some ideas out there: imaging (e.g. super resolution techniques / live-imaging in neuronal cultures (photoactivation or bleaching) / two-photon in vivo imaging in mice) has really changed since the past 15 years when I took the course. Whole cell patch clamping in vivo in mice also is not unusual any more.

The course was given in the second half of the summer. During the first half I worked for John P. ‰ÛÏTrink‰Û Trinkaus on Fundulus development. I was an undergraduate assistant in his lab at Yale during the academic year. The summer of 1952 I took the Physiology Course. Both courses were inspirational. In the Invert Course we learned a lot of anatomy and taxonomy of local fauna. Converting the Invert Course to Neural Systems was a very good idea.      I returned to Woods Hole the summer of 1957 having completed a doctorate in Physiology and begun working the laboratory of Harry Grundfest, a long time summer investigator. Harry was the organizer and ran the lecture series on electrobiology fondly known as the Monday night fights. This series was ultimately taken over by the Neurobiology course.     I have been coming to the lab every summer since 1957 (and, as an aside, have run every Falmouth Road Race). I believe it was 1969 when then Director H. Burr Steinbach invited me to be on the Education Committee, probably with the reasonable charge of organizing a neurobiology course. As a product of two courses in the standard MBL mode of modules, a Neurobiology Course on the model seemed a reasonable project to me, and to lessen the burden I asked John Dowling to join me as Co-Director. There had been postdoctoral neurophysiology programs under Steve Kuffler and also Cole and Moore, but these were of a different format; generally, the students spent the entire summer working on a single project.     On at least one occasion I lectured in the Neural Systems Course. The subject was likely to have been electric fishes, electroreception or electrical synapses. It was just after the great Coffee Causes Pancreatic Cancer scare. As I recall the statistical analysis had just been shown to be faulty. I had switched to tea during the scare, and during the break in the two hour lecture, I thought I might just as well shift back to coffee. As a result my mood was significantly elevated during the second hour. Although tea is supposed to contain almost as much caffeine as coffee, during the off period I had lost my tolerance to caffeine.     On other occasions I have done such things as help the students find electric organs in gymnotid fishes. I also participate in the Wednesday night seminars, mostly to have the lights turned down so they don‰Ûªt get into the eyes of the people up front (like me). ",6-10 years,"Grass Fellowship, Summer investigator, Invited lecturer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
